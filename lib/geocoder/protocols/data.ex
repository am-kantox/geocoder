    - **address**: simple string, designationg an address, or itâ€™s part.
    - **components**: the component filters, separated by a pipe (|).
    Each component filter consists of a component:value pair and will fully restrict
    the results from the geocoder.
    - **place_id**: The place ID is a unique identifier that can be used with other Google APIs.
    For example, you can use the placeID returned by the
    [Google Maps Roads API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/snap)
    to get the address for a snapped point. For more information about place IDs, see the
    [place ID overview](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id).
    The place ID may only be specified if the request includes
    an API key or a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan client ID.
    - **result_type**: examples of address types: `country`, `street_address`, `postal_code`.
    For a full list of allowable values, see
    the [address types](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#Types).
    Specifying a type will restrict the results to this type.
    If multiple types are specified, the API will return all addresses
    that match any of the types. _**Note:** this parameter is available only for
    requests that include an API key or a client ID._
    If both `result_type` and `location_type` restrictions are present
    then the API will return only those results that matches
    both the `result_type` and the `location_type` restrictions.
